# API Design and Fundamentals of Google Cloud's Apigee API Platform
# Product Apigee, Google Cloud's API management platform Overview
* Apigee's API management platform aims to bridge the gap and simplify the complexity of back-end systems. 
* By building APIs for connected experiences, organizations can create abstraction layers that reduce complexity. 
* Apigee offers a range of capabilities and features such as security, caching, transformation, and mediation, 
* allowing the customization of APIs to suit individual application needs and adapt to changing business requirements.

The lecture also highlights the significance of APIs in participating in ecosystems, driving business growth and success. The digital value chain is explained, illustrating how connected digital experiences are realized through applications built by developers. APIs built and managed by the API team provide access to back-end resources while shielding application developers from unnecessary complexity.

Apigee's platform is composed of four core capabilities: API runtime deployment models, mediation for request and response manipulation, analytics for data-driven decision-making, and the developer ecosystem facilitated through API products and the developer portal.

The lecture concludes by introducing Apigee's logical components, including the runtime gateway, message processor, runtime data store, analytics events, Apigee API for platform management, management database, Apigee console, and developer portal. Deployment options are also discussed, with Google Cloud-managed software-as-a-service being the most popular, and a hybrid deployment model available for multi-cloud or on-premises scenarios.

Throughout the course, learners will use the Google Cloud hosted deployment option for their labs, gaining hands-on experience as API developers. The operational management may differ between deployment models, but the developer experience remains consistent.
